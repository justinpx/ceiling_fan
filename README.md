# Ceiling Fan
This is a command line app designed to simulate the functions of a simple ceiling fan. This ceiling fan has 2 pull cords
, one reverses the direction of the fan blades, and the other cycles through the fan speeds and the off setting. The fan
is always receiving power.

## Usage
To use this app, launch it from the command line using `py main.py` or by running `run.bat`. When it starts, a ceiling
fan will be generated, and you will be prompted with options to reverse the direction, cycle through the settings, or 
exit the app.
